  <u><p style="font-size: 100px">Why you should get a gaming pc</p></u>
  <div class="Garamond"><h1>Number 1</h1>
  <div class="Garamond"><p style="font-size: 30px">Now, the first reason why you should get a pc is because pc's are really reliable and they last a long time. I have had my gaming pc for almost 4 years now. It is still a very good gaming pc but there is some things that I would like to upgrade like the ram, motherboard, graphics card, and the cpu. Most PC's last for 5-8 years before having big problems.</p>

  <div class="Garamond"><h1>Number 2</h1>
 <div class="Garamond"><p style="font-size: 30px">Now you may ask "Why should I get a pc, they are so expensive!I may as well get a xbox or a ps4" Well you should get a pc because you can do a lot more things than Xbox's or Ps4's.</p>

  <div class="Garamond"><h1>Number 3</h1>
  <div class="Garamond"><p style="font-size: 30px">You can plug a controller into your pc and have way better performance because consoles only have 60fps rather than the 100+ fps that computers have.</p>
